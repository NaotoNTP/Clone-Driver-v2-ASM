# Clownacy's Sonic 2 Clone Driver v2 (v2.8.0.1)

This is a heavily-modified version of Sonic 1's SMPS sound driver (which itself is a modified SMPS 68k Type 1b).
It is designed to maximise compatibility with music from Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Chaotix.

You can find more information at the GitHub repository's wiki:
https://github.com/Clownacy/Sonic-2-Clone-Driver-v2/wiki

This driver is designed for use with 'The Macroassembler AS', found here:

NOTE: This is a preservationary fork of Clownacy's Sonic 2 Clone Driver v2.8.0.1 prior to the migration to C++.
I have created this to ensure ease-of-access to this version of the driver for those who prefer it as, at the 
time of writing, the ASM version is not preserved via a branch of the original repository. It is still possible 
to access to original ASM verison through the commit history, but this will eventually be buried as development 
of the C++ version continues. Feel free to open issues/pull-requests for bugs and bugfixes; I can't promise I'll 
be timely with responses or implementation, but I'll do my best to offer some form of maintenance/support.
